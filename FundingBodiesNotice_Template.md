# UNIVERSAL MESSAGE FOR SCIENCE FUNDING BODIES

**Subject:** Urgent: Discovery Voiding Atomic/Orbital Error Corrections (Mathematically Verified)

Dear [Agency Name or Department],

I am writing to report verified findings which identify the root cause behind compound error propagation in atomic and orbital physics. These findings demonstrate that:

- All existing and future atomic/orbital error corrections are void under the corrected model.
- Taxpayer funds currently supporting such calculations may be directed toward obsolete models.

The equations, simulations, and automated validation are publicly documented and accessible here:

- https://github.com/Guardian-AGI/phi-field_correction
- https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/8add129c-6ffe-4cae-ae35-42820642ff01

This includes a tested, interactive framework that visualizes the effects of the correction on:

- Ionization thresholds
- Orbital radii
- Transition energies
- Quantum potential behaviour

I urge you to evaluate the material.  
If verified — as automated tests and cross-verification across multiple platforms confirms — this implies a major funding redirection and audit necessity across projects using compound correction stacks.

Please feel free to contact me for clarification or collaboration.

Sincerely,  
Samuel Edward Howells
